# Providing Thermal Comfort at Home/Office Automation

![Thermal Comfort](one.jpg)

This project aims to enhance thermal comfort in home and office environments through automation. By leveraging semi-supervised algorithms and the `pythermalcomfort` library, the project assesses the thermal comfort of individuals within rooms. It utilizes Support Vector Regression (SVR) for Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) calculations and classifies thermal sensation levels based on ASHRAE standards, while also introducing innovations to the UC Berkeley "pythermalcomfort" package.

## Features

- Assesses thermal comfort using SVR (PMV) calculations.
- Classifies thermal sensation levels with semi-supervised algorithms.
- Adapts to the standards set by ASHRAE for comprehensive analysis.
- Introduces enhancements to the "pythermalcomfort" package from UC Berkeley.
