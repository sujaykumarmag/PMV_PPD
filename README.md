# PMV PPD Prediction


The PMV and PPD prediction project uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms to predict key predictors such as temperature, humidity, and air velocity. By accurately predicting these factors, the project can provide reliable thermal comfort assessments. The project also incorporates semi-supervised algorithms such as KMeans clustering with logistic regression to classify thermal sensation levels as good or not good and identify the specific level of discomfort if present. This allows for a more dynamic and personalized assessment of thermal comfort that better reflects the needs and preferences of the occupants.

The project is scalable and can be integrated into existing systems using a variety of sensors and data collection methods. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the specific needs of the user. The use of semi-supervised algorithms allows for a more responsive and nuanced system that can adapt to changes in the environment and occupants over time. Overall, the PMV and PPD prediction project is a powerful tool for accurately assessing thermal comfort in a variety of settings, including residential, commercial, and industrial spaces.
